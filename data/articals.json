        "text":"As much as we live and breath monochrome styles (and we can all agree a majority of our daily wear is crisp whites and deep blacks), a gals gotta have a bit of fun with her wardrobe! We're style crushing hard over colour popping styles at the moment, especially mustard tones! Take our Love Bird dress for example, the cutest mini dress to hit the shelves this season - and its beyond versatile! If you're sitting there thinking but i'm just not that game, its way too much colour for me, the fix is simple! add a casual denim jacket to block the colour pop and a simple tan sandal - let the dress speak for itself without overpowering your style!However, if you're game to the nines (which we all should be a few days in the year) pair it with some bold tones (we low key love to team it with a pair of red mules) & coloured accessories to really get the colour pop ball rolling!"
